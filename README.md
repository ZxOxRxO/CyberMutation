ReZori is a PC cyberpunk game of hacking that will be developed using at least Unity version 6.
All characters, 3D models, and animations will be modeled in Blender.
Players take on the character of Zori, a once ordinary human who became a post-human hacker
after he escaped digital slavery. In ReZori, their mission is to liberate six hospitals infected by
Dr. Brayan's biological ransomware. Using real-world hacking techniques, players must restore
digital freedom and rescue humanity from a foreboding fate being transformed into human-
based computers. Each hospital features a unique hacking structure, with increasing difficulty as
the game progresses.
